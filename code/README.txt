List of m functions.

For image filtering:

	proj1_test_filtering.m
	in which 
	my_imfilter2.m will be called (completed based on my_filter.m) -- deal with filtering

For hybrid image:
	proj1.m
	in which
	vis_hybrid_image.m will be called -- deal with hybrid (in space domain)
	seperate_cutoff.m -- deal with different cutoff frequency for two overlaping images
	proj1_fft.m --> an example in frequency domain filter
	            --> notice: only apply to cat.bmp and dog.bmp
	in which
	my_imfilter.m will be called -- deal with hybrid (in frequency domain)

Just for illustration:
	gaussian.m -- just to show related gaussian image.

Thank you for your patience.
